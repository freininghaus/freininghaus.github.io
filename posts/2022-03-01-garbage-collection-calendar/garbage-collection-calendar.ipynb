    "* residual waste, which contains all the rest (except batteries, dangerous chemicals and a couple of other things, which people have to bring to collection facilities themselves).\n",

However, there are different schedules for the different kinds of waste (biweekly or every four weeks in my part of the city). Moreover, in weeks with bank holidays, the collection is often shifted to another weekday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the city council provides [iCalendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) files (`*.ical`) with all waste collection dates for the current year [at its website](https://serviceportal.aachen.de/abfallnavi).

    "1. The [source of this post](index.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook, which you can download, modify, and run with an iCalendar file yourself.\n",
