    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the third in a series of posts that build a Brainfuck interpreter in Rust.\n",
    "*   In the [first post](../../../../2024/02/04/brainfuck-interpreter-in-rust-part1), we created the first building blocks for our Brainfuck interpreter in Rust: a data structure for the tape, and a data type for the instructions. The instructions are based on Rust's enums, which allow to build powerful [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type).\n",
    "*   In the [second post](../../../../2024/03/31/brainfuck-interpreter-in-rust-part2), we built an execution engine that can execute a Brainfuck program which is represented by an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) in the context of a tape. We used the `Read` and `Write` traits to make our execution function generic, such that we could not only read from standard input and write to standard output, but also, e.g., read from byte slices and write to a vector of bytes. This makes unit testing easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we can only execute programs which are given as abstract syntax trees in Rust data structures, such as ***TODO: use a program with < and >. Maybe the Fibonacci one?***\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "vec![\n",
    "    Read,\n",
    "    Loop(vec![Write, Dec]),\n",
    "    Write\n",
    "];\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Brainfuck source code, this looks like this: `,[.-].`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current post, we will find ways to transform the latter into the former, i.e., to parse Brainfuck source code and generate an abstract syntax tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Please note:** I intentionally did this first without using libraries. I wanted to build a simple parser from scratch, and I found that I learned a lot this way. Therefore, I found it appropriate to write a blog post about it. However, building a parser with the help of libraries that are designed for this purpose is **much** easier and less error-prone. In a future post in this series, we will implement a better parser using the [Rust crate nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/).*\n",

    "In Rust, functions that can fail usually return a value of the type `Result<T, E>`, where `T` is the type that a successful execution of the function would yield, and `E` is an error type. For `read_exact(...)`, which returns no useful information in the successful case, `T` is `()`, the empty type.\n",

    "Using `unwrap` is useful in two situations:\n",
    "*   If we are 100% sure that there cannot be an `Err` value in the result because we know that some preconditions are fulfilled which guarantee success.\n",
    "*   If a panic is acceptable, e.g., because we are just experimenting, and not writing production code.\n",

So our use of traits to define conditions that the type must fulfil corresponds more to concepts in C++ than to interfaces in Java. However, traits can also be used in a more dynamic way, such that only one version of the function exists in assembly and machine code, and dispatch is done dynamically at runtime with virtual function calls. This is more like what interfaces in Java and abstract base classes in C++ are used for.\n",
