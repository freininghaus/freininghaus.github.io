    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the third in a series of posts that build a Brainfuck interpreter in Rust.\n",
    "*   In the [first post](../../../../2024/02/04/brainfuck-interpreter-in-rust-part1), we created the first building blocks for our Brainfuck interpreter in Rust: a data structure for the tape, and a data type for the instructions. The instructions are based on Rust's enums, which allow to build powerful [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type).\n",
    "*   In the [second post](../../../../2024/03/31/brainfuck-interpreter-in-rust-part2), we built an execution engine that can execute a Brainfuck program which is represented by an [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) in the context of a tape. We used the `Read` and `Write` traits to make our execution function generic, such that we could not only read from standard input and write to standard output, but also, e.g., read from byte slices and write to a vector of bytes. This makes unit testing easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we can only execute programs which are given as abstract syntax trees in Rust data structures, such as ***TODO: use a program with < and >. Maybe the Fibonacci one?***\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "vec![\n",
    "    Read,\n",
    "    Loop(vec![Write, Dec]),\n",
    "    Write\n",
    "];\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Brainfuck source code, this looks like this: `,[.-].`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current post, we will find ways to transform the latter into the former, i.e., to parse Brainfuck source code and generate an abstract syntax tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Please note:** I intentionally did this first without using libraries. I wanted to build a simple parser from scratch, and I found that I learned a lot this way. Therefore, I found it appropriate to write a blog post about it. However, building a parser with the help of libraries that are designed for this purpose is **much** easier and less error-prone. In a future post in this series, we will implement a better parser using the [Rust crate nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/).*\n",

    "*   If we are 100% sure that there cannot be an `Err` value in the result because we know that some preconditions are fulfilled which guarantee success.\n",
    "*   If a panic is acceptable, e.g., because we are just experimenting, and not writing production code.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. <span id=\"fn:initial-state-all-zeroes\">Note</span> that Brainfuck programs usually operate on a tape which has all cells initialized to zero. So strictly speaking, a program that only sums the initial cell values does not make much sense. It is only used to test our intermediate step on the way to a full-featured Brainfuck execution engine here.[&#8617;](#fnref:initial-state-all-zeroes)\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  <span id=\"fn:trait-objects\">Our</span> generic function `write<W: Write>(...)` is like a template in C++ in the sense that the compiler will generate separate assembly for each type that the function is used with. So our use of traits to define conditions that the type must fulfil corresponds more to concepts in C++ than to interfaces in Java. However, traits can also be used in a more dynamic way, such that only one version of the function exists in assembly and machine code, and dispatch is done dynamically at runtime with virtual function calls. This is more like what interfaces in Java and abstract base classes in C++ are used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is an example function, which gets a so-called *trait object* as a parameter:\n",
    "    ```rust\n",
    "    fn write_trait_object(w: &mut dyn Write, value: u8) {\n",
    "        let mut buf: [u8; 1] = [value];\n",
    "        w.write_all(&mut buf).unwrap();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    It can be called with standard output as the writer like this:\n",
    "    ```rust\n",
    "    write_trait_object(&mut std::io::stdout(), b'#');\n",
    "    write_trait_object(&mut std::io::stdout(), b'\\n');\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    The differences to our earlier function `write<W: Write>(...)` are:\n",
    "    *   Only one version of the function exists for all types in machine code, so the size of the compiled program might be lower.\n",
    "    *   Due to dynamic dispatch at runtime, there may be a small performance penalty. Moreover, the compiler cannot perform optimizations for specific types that the function is used with. This could harm performance and increase the size of the compiled program.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    It can be tempting to use static dispatch and have the compiler generate optimal code for each type to improve the performance, but adding type annotations to functions and structs also has costs. In particular, it can harm developer productivity if done too excessively. The other day, I read a [very interesting blog post about a refactoring to static dispatch that the author considered a mistake](https://jmmv.dev/2023/08/rust-static-dispatch-failed-experiment.html).[&#8617;](#fnref:trait-objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  <span id=\"fn:type-deduction\">Note</span> that we do not have to state the type `Vec<u8>` explicitly when we create the Vec with `Vec::new()`. We could do it in two different ways:\n",
    "    ```rust\n",
    "    let mut data: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    or\n",
    "    ```rust\n",
    "    let mut data = Vec::<u8>::new();\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    But the Rust compiler will deduce the type automatically here because we call the `write(...)` method of the `Write` trait on it, which `Vec<T>` only implements for `T` is `u8`.[&#8617;](#fnref:type-deduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  <span id=\"fn:variable-scope\">I</span> have wrapped the code in this cell in braces (`{...}`) because compilation will fail with this error otherwise:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Error: The variable input contains a reference with a non-static lifetime so can't be persisted. You can prevent this error by making sure that the variable goes out of scope - i.e. wrapping the code in {}.`\n",

    "    You would not have this problem outside a Jupyter notebook, because then `input` would have a well-define life time.\n",

    "    ```rust\n",
    "    let input = 0;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Then the old variable `input` would also go out of scope. In Rust, variable names can be reused in the same scope, which can be confusing at first. I found this feature quite useful though after I got used to it.[&#8617;](#fnref:variable-scope)"
