    "1.  <span id=\"fn:trait-objects\">Our</span> generic function `write<W: Write>(...)` is like a template in C++ in the sense that the compiler will generate separate assembly for each type that the function is used with. So our use of traits to define conditions that the type must fulfil corresponds more to concepts in C++ than to interfaces in Java. However, traits can also be used in a more dynamic way, such that only one version of the function exists in assembly and machine code, and dispatch is done dynamically at runtime with virtual function calls. This is more like what interfaces in Java and abstract base classes in C++ are used for.\n",
    "\n",

    "    write_trait_object(&mut std::io::stdout(), b'\\n');\n",

    "    The differences to our earlier function `write<W: Write>(...)` are:\n",
    "    *   Only one version of the function exists for all types in machine code, so the size of the compiled program might be lower.\n",
    "    *   Due to dynamic dispatch at runtime, there may be a small performance penalty. Moreover, the compiler cannot perform optimizations for specific types that the function is used with. This could harm performance and increase the size of the compiled program.\n",
    "  \n",
    "    It can be tempting to use static dispatch and have the compiler generate optimal code for each type to improve the performance, but adding type annotations to functions and structs also has costs. In particular, it can harm developer productivity if done too excessively.

    "    let mut data: Vec<u8> = Vec::new();\n",
