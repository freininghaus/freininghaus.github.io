However, there are different schedules for the different kinds of waste (biweekly or every four weeks in my part of the city). Moreover, in weeks with bank holidays, the collection is often shifted to another weekday.\n",

    "1. The [source of this post](index.ipynb) is a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook, which you can download, modify, and run with an iCalendar file yourself.\n",

    "1. <span id=\"fn:ics-serialization\">The</span> first version of this post serialized the new calendar with `f.writelines(new_calendar)` because a `Calendar` object happily behaved like an iterable of strings that produces the file contents line by line. However, as of today (January 4, 2023), this results in a deprecation warning. In future versions of ics, this will not work any more. Moreover, even if the `serialize()` function is used, there is still an unnecessary deprecation warning with ics 0.7.2. This has been [fixed already](https://github.com/ics-py/ics-py/pull/361), but version 0.7.2 does not contain the fix yet. Until a new version is released, a branch version without this issue can be installed with `pip install git+https://github.com/ics-py/ics-py@version-0.7`. [&#8617;](#fnref:ics-serialization)"
