&lt;p&gt;I used to have a Wordpress blog at &lt;a href="https://freininghaus.wordpress.com/"&gt;https://freininghaus.wordpress.com/&lt;/a&gt;. I started it when I got involved more and more with &lt;a href="https://kde.org/"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; and especially its file manager Dolphin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I stopped working on KDE because of changes in my personal life, one of the main reasons for writing blog posts regularly was gone. So I quit blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have missed writing in public though, and I have accumulated quite a few posts in various stages of completion during the past few years. And I have ideas for even more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I could never motivate myself to revive my old blog, among other things because static site generators look much more attractive than platforms like Wordpress to me now. Therefore, I have finally decided to start something new. After looking at a few of the many options available, I chose &lt;a href="https://getnikola.com"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt;, mostly because of its native suppot for &lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/"&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; notebooks, and because I felt that I can get a result that I am happy with without investing too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will write about my adventures in software development and other topics that I care about. I hope that this will be fun and will also help myself to structure my thoughts better and preserve them for my future self. If that turns out to be interesting for a wider audience, then this is an appreciated side effect, but not the main goal.&lt;/p&gt;
